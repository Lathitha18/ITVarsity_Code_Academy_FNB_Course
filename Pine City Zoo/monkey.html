                    <h3>Monkey</h3>
                    </p>Monkeys are large, intelligent primates known for their agility and playful behavior.
                    They inhabit a variety of environments, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountainous regions.
                    Monkeys are social animals, often living in troops that provide protection and support to one another.
                    They have a diverse diet, feeding on fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals.</p>

                    <p>Monkeys are highly intelligent and adaptable primates belonging to the infraorder Simiiformes,
                    and they represent one of the most diverse and widespread groups of mammals on Earth.
                    They are generally divided into two main categories: <b>Old World monkeys</b>,
                    which are native to Africa and Asia (like baboons, vervets, and macaques), 
                    and <b>New World monkeys</b>, found throughout Central and South America 
                    (such as capuchins, tamarins, and spider monkeys). Their sizes vary widely, from the tiny pygmy marmoset,
                    which can fit in the palm of your hand, to the powerful mandrill with its vivid facial coloration and impressive build.
                    Whether leaping through dense rainforests or scampering across sun-baked savannas, monkeys have evolved an impressive range of survival strategies.</p>

                    <p>One of the most striking traits of monkeys is their cognitive intelligence. Many species exhibit advanced problem-solving abilities,
                    tool use, and even elements of cultural learning. They are highly social animals, living in structured groups with hierarchies, alliances, and complex dynamics.
                    Grooming is a fundamental behavior that goes beyond hygiene—it's a form of bonding, negotiation, and stress relief. 
                    Their methods of communication include everything from expressive facial gestures and postures to vocal calls and alarm cries that alert others to danger. 
                    Some monkeys are even capable of recognizing themselves in mirrors—an indication of self-awareness that's rare in the animal kingdom.</p>

                    <p>Monkeys are omnivores, although most species lean toward a plant-based diet. Their meals may consist of fruits, leaves, seeds, flowers, insects, and occasionally small animals or bird eggs. 
                    Their diverse diets often reflect the ecosystems they inhabit, and many play vital roles in seed dispersal, helping forests regenerate. With long limbs, opposable thumbs, and—among New World species—a prehensile tail, monkeys are incredibly agile climbers and acrobats.
                    These physical adaptations not only aid in movement but also in foraging and social play. Despite their adaptability, however, many monkey populations are under threat from habitat destruction, hunting, and the illegal pet trade.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the monkeys at the monkey cage near the Monkey Trail.</p>
