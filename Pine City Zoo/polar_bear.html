                    <h3>Polar Bear</h3>
                    </p>Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are large, white-furred bears native to the Arctic region. They are well adapted to life on the sea ice, with a thick layer of blubber and dense fur that insulates them from the cold. Adult polar bears typically weigh between 300-700 kg (660-1,540 lbs) and are excellent swimmers, using their powerful front limbs to paddle through the water.</p>

                    <p>Polar bears are primarily carnivorous, with a diet mainly consisting of seals. They have strong jaws and sharp teeth adapted for catching and eating their prey. Despite their diet, polar bears are classified as carnivores and have been known to eat small animals or carrion on rare occasions.</p>

                    <p>Due to habitat loss and low reproductive rates, polar bears are considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts have been implemented to protect their natural habitat and increase their population in the wild. Polar bears are also a symbol of wildlife conservation worldwide.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find them beyond the Northern Frontier</p>
