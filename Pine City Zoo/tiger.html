                    <h3>Tiger</h3>
                    </p>Tigers (Panthera tigris) are the largest members of the cat family and among the most iconic predators on Earth. Native to Asia, they once roamed from eastern Turkey to the Russian Far East and the Indonesian islands, but today their range is fragmented and limited to parts of India, Southeast Asia, and the Russian Far East. Tigers are instantly recognizable by their muscular build, powerful jaws, and bold black stripes over orange furâ€”a camouflage pattern that helps them stalk prey in forests and grasslands..</p>

                    <p>There are several subspecies, including the Bengal, Siberian, Sumatran, Malayan, Indochinese, and the critically endangered South China tiger. Males can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lbs) and measure over 3 meters (10 feet) in length, including the tail. Tigers are solitary and territorial, using scent markings and vocalizations to communicate. They are apex predators, hunting deer, wild pigs, and other large mammals, often ambushing their prey with stealth and explosive power.</p>

                    <p>Tigers are also deeply symbolic in many cultures, representing strength, courage, and mystery. Sadly, they are endangered, with fewer than 5,000 left in the wild due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are ongoing, including protected reserves, anti-poaching patrols, and breeding programs.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the tigers above the gorilla enclosure.</p>
