                    <h3>Gemsbok</h3>
                    </p>Gemsbok are large, majestic antelope belonging to the genus Oryx and the family Bovidae.
                    Native to the dry and open landscapes of Southern Africa, particularly the Kalahari and Namib deserts, 
                    they have become icons of survival in some of Earth’s most challenging environments. 
                    Both male and female gemsbok sport striking black-and-white facial markings and long, straight horns, which can reach up to 85 cm (33 in) in length.
                    These horns serve as powerful weapons against predators and are also used in ritualized displays to assert dominance. 
                    Their sturdy frames and sleek, tan-colored coats allow them to blend beautifully into the desert terrain,
                    while their muscular builds help them navigate rocky and sandy habitats with grace.</p>

                    <p>All gemsbok have several remarkable adaptations, the most impressive being their ability to thrive in extreme heat and arid conditions.
                    They can go for weeks without drinking water, drawing moisture from desert vegetation such as grasses, succulents, and wild melons. 
                    Their large nasal passages help cool the blood traveling to their brains, acting as a natural air-conditioning system.
                    Gemsbok also regulate their body temperature through behavioral means—such as seeking shade during peak heat—and can tolerate body temperatures several degrees higher than many other mammals.
                    Males tend to be more solitary or form bachelor groups, while females and their offspring live in herds, guided by older matriarchs with sharp memories of seasonal resources.</p>

                    <p>Gemsbok are herbivorous grazers and browsers and can be found in deserts, grasslands, and scrublands. 
                    They tend to favor regions with sparse vegetation and wide visibility to help detect predators, although they occasionally venture into more vegetated areas after rainfall.
                    Because they are primarily diurnal, they are most active during the cooler hours of the morning and late afternoon. Predators include lions, leopards, and hyenas, but a fully grown gemsbok's formidable horns and tough hide make it a difficult meal.
                    Their social structure and constant vigilance help ensure the safety of the herd, especially the young calves who are vulnerable in open terrain</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the gemsboks just beyond Panda Canyon.</p>
