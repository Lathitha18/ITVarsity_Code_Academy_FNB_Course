                    <h3>Lion</h3>
                    </p>Lions are social big cats that live in groups called prides. They are known for their majestic manes and powerful roars. Adult male lions typically weigh between 150-250 kg (330-550 lbs), while females are smaller, weighing 120-182 kg (265-400 lbs). Lions are found in a variety of habitats, including savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands.</p>

                    <p>Lions are carnivorous predators, primarily hunting large ungulates such as zebras and wildebeests. They are known for their cooperative hunting strategies, often working together to take down prey. After a successful hunt, lions will consume large quantities of meat, often feeding for several days on a single kill.</p>

                    <p>Despite their size, lions are vulnerable to predators like hyenas, especially when drinking water, which requires them to awkwardly splay their legs.
                    Their height gives them an excellent vantage point to spot danger, and their powerful kicks can be lethal. Lions are also known for their subtle communication,
                    including infrasonic sounds and even nighttime humming, which researchers believe may help them stay connected in the dark.</p>

                    <p>Lions are social and territorial, with each individual maintaining a home range marked by scent glands. Males produce deep bellows to communicate and establish dominance, especially during mating season. Females give birth to tiny, underdeveloped cubs that crawl into their mothers' dens, where they continue to grow for several months. Lions face threats from habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, and are currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier.</p>
