                    <h3>Koala</h3>
                    </p>Koalas are iconic, tree-dwelling marsupials native to the eucalyptus forests of eastern and southern Australia. Despite often being called “koala bears,” they’re not bears at all—they belong to the family Phascolarctidae and are closely related to wombats. Koalas are instantly recognizable by their stout, tailless bodies, large fluffy ears, and leathery black noses. Adults typically measure 60–85 cm (24–33 in) in length and weigh between 4–15 kg (9–33 lbs), with southern populations generally larger than their northern counterparts</p>

                    <p>Koalas are specialist herbivores, feeding almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and contain toxins that most animals can’t digest. To survive on this tough diet, koalas have a highly adapted digestive system, including a long cecum filled with bacteria that break down the leaves. Because of their low-energy diet, koalas sleep up to 20 hours a day, conserving energy while perched in the forks of trees. Their strong limbs and sharp claws help them grip branches securely, and their opposable digits make them excellent climbers</p>

                    <p>Koalas are solitary and territorial, with each individual maintaining a home range marked by scent glands. Males produce deep bellows to communicate and establish dominance, especially during mating season. Females give birth to tiny, underdeveloped joeys that crawl into their pouches, where they continue to grow for several months. Koalas face threats from habitat loss, disease (like chlamydia), and climate change, and are currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
