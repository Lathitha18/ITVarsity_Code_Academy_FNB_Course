                    <h3>Giraffe</h3>
                    </p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, instantly recognizable by their towering necks, long legs, and beautifully patterned coats.
                    Native to the savannas and open woodlands of Africa, giraffes belong to the genus Giraffa and are divided into several species, including the Masai, reticulated, and southern giraffes.
                    Adult males can reach heights of up to <strong>5.5 meters (18 feet)</strong> and weigh over <strong>1,900 kg (4,200 pounds)</strong>, while females are slightly smaller. 
                    Their long necks, despite having only seven vertebrae like most mammals, allow them to browse leaves, fruits, and flowers from treetops that few other animals can reach—especially their favorite, the acacia tree.</p>

                    <p>Giraffes are highly social and often form loose, open herds without a strict hierarchy. 
                    Males engage in a unique behavior called “necking,” where they swing their necks like battering rams to establish dominance.
                    Their gait is equally distinctive: they move both legs on one side of the body at the same time, giving them a graceful, swaying stride. 
                    When galloping, they can reach speeds of up to <strong>60 km/h (37 mph)</strong> over short distances. 
                    Their long, prehensile tongues—up to <strong>45 cm (18 inches)</strong>—are perfectly adapted for stripping leaves from thorny branches.</p>

                    <p>Despite their size, giraffes are vulnerable to predators like lions and hyenas, especially when drinking water, which requires them to awkwardly splay their legs.
                    Their height gives them an excellent vantage point to spot danger, and their powerful kicks can be lethal. Giraffes are also known for their subtle communication, 
                    including infrasonic sounds and even nighttime humming, which researchers believe may help them stay connected in the dark.</p>

                    <p>One of the most striking traits of giraffes is their unique feeding behavior. They are browsers, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees and shrubs.
                    Their long necks and tongues allow them to reach high foliage that other herbivores cannot access. 
                    Giraffes are also known to engage in a behavior called "necking," where males swing their necks and heads to strike each other in combat, establishing dominance and social hierarchy.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the giraffes at G15, just beyond the research centre.</p>
