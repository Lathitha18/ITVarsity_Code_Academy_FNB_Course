                    <h3>Gorilla</h3>
                    </p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, known for their immense strength, intelligence, and deep social bonds. Native to the dense tropical forests of equatorial Africa, they belong to the genus Gorilla and are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, each with their own subspecies. Adult males, called silverbacks, can weigh up to 270 kg (600 lbs) and lead family groups with care and authority.</p>

                    <p>Despite their powerful build, gorillas are gentle and mostly herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and occasionally insects. They communicate through vocalizations, chest-beating, facial expressions, and even tool useâ€”showcasing their remarkable intelligence. Gorillas are primarily ground-dwelling and move using a unique knuckle-walking gait. They build nests each night for sleeping, either on the ground or in trees, depending on the species and habitat.</p>

                    <p>Despite their size, giraffes are vulnerable to predators like lions and hyenas, especially when drinking water, which requires them to awkwardly splay their legs.
                    Their height gives them an excellent vantage point to spot danger, and their powerful kicks can be lethal. Giraffes are also known for their subtle communication, 
                    including infrasonic sounds and even nighttime humming, which researchers believe may help them stay connected in the dark.</p>

                    <p>Sadly, gorillas are critically endangered, facing threats from habitat destruction, poaching, and disease. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these majestic creatures and the ecosystems they call home.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the gorilla cage at GO12.</p>
