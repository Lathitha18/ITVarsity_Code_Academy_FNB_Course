                    <h3>Warthog</h3>
                    </p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are rugged, tusked wild pigs native to the grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Despite their comical appearance—marked by facial “warts,” bristly manes, and curved tusks—they are incredibly tough and resourceful animals. Warthogs use their powerful snouts and tusks to dig for roots and tubers, often kneeling on their front legs while foraging. They are omnivorous, feeding on grasses, berries, insects, and even carrion when necessary.</p>

                    <p>Warthogs are well adapted to harsh environments. They wallow in mud to cool off and protect their skin from parasites and sunburn. At night or during extreme heat, they retreat into burrows—often abandoned aardvark holes—which they enter backward to defend themselves with their tusks facing outward. Socially, they live in small family groups called sounders, usually made up of females and their young, while males tend to be more solitary.</p>

                    <p>Though they may look awkward, warthogs can run at speeds of up to 55 km/h (34 mph) to escape predators like lions, leopards, and hyenas. Their alertness and agility make them surprisingly difficult prey.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the warthogs near the elephant and kangaroo enclosure.</p>
