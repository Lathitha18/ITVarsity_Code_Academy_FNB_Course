                    <h3>Kangaroo</h3>
                    </p>Kangaroos are large marsupials native to Australia, known for their powerful hind legs and unique hopping movement. They are well adapted to the open grasslands and forests of their homeland. Adult kangaroos can weigh between 40-100 kg (88-220 lbs) and are known for their strong tails, which they use for balance while hopping.</p>

                    <p>Kangaroos are primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, leaves, and shoots. They have strong jaws and teeth adapted for grazing on tough plant material. Despite their diet, kangaroos are classified as herbivores and have been known to eat small animals or carrion on rare occasions.</p>

                    <p>Due to habitat loss and low reproductive rates, kangaroos are considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts have been implemented to protect their natural habitat and increase their population in the wild. Kangaroos are also a symbol of wildlife conservation worldwide.</p>
