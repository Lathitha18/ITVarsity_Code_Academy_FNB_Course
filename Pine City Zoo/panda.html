                    <h3>Panda</h3>
                    </p>Pandas are large, bear-like mammals known for their distinctive black and white coloring. They primarily inhabit bamboo forests in China and are famous for their diet, which consists almost entirely of bamboo shoots and leaves. Adult giant pandas typically weigh between 70-160 kg (154-352 lbs) and have a stocky build with strong limbs.</p>

                    <p>Pandas are primarily herbivorous, with bamboo making up about 99% of their diet. They have strong jaws and teeth adapted for crushing tough bamboo stalks. Despite their diet, pandas are classified as carnivores and have been known to eat small animals or carrion on rare occasions.</p>

                    <p>Due to habitat loss and low reproductive rates, giant pandas are considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts have been implemented to protect their natural habitat and increase their population in the wild. Pandas are also a symbol of wildlife conservation worldwide.</p>
