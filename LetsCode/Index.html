        <h1>Lathitha' Scrapbook</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone this is Lathitha's first IT Varsity Website!</p>
        <H2>How is coding so far?</H2>
        <p>Actually learning by myself is actually easier,
        <br>although being a with other people or learning code with friends would be much more fun!<br>
            <br> I would choose this over anything.</p>
        <h3>What would you like to pursue after high school?</h3>
        <P>I would prefer something with coding/informatics, however it requires you to do Math in high school, which i havent done.</P>
